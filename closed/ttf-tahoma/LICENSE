Microsoft licenses existing fonts from various font vendors and also commissions
original fonts. If you want to license a particular font, you should contact the
vendor directly. The vendor will be listed in the font's copyright or trademark
entry. Use the free Font properties extension to access this information.

Until recently most fonts that include a Microsoft copyright or trademark notice
have been available only as part of Microsoft products. Although some fonts
remain Microsoft-exclusive, a number of Microsoft fonts are now available to end
users, independent software vendors (ISVs), and original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) under license from Ascender Corporation (http://www.ascendercorp.com/).
These include Verdana, Georgia, Comic Sans MS, Microsoft Sans Serif, Nina,
Tahoma, Wingdings, Webdings, and Trebuchet MS.

For more information regarding fonts, and links to font vendors, visit the
Microsoft Typography Web site (http://www.microsoft.com/typography/).
