This is my Arch Linux repository with lots of GNOME and Ayatana stuff. You can use it as a source repo, or if you use an i686 system, you can add the following lines to /etc/pacman.conf to install binary packages directly with pacman:

[ayatana]
Server = http://repo.ayatana.info/


Folders:
apps           - miscellaneous individual applications
apps-ayatana   - individual applications that interact with Ayatana components (depend on libappindicator, libindicate or libunity)
apps-map       - individual applications for display maps or interact with GPS
gnome          - GNOME applications that not included in official repos
mint           - Linux Mint themes and applications
others         - other system components
themes         - individual desktop and icon themes and fonts
